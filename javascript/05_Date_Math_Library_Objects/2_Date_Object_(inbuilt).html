			Date is an inbuilt (library) Constructor provided by default with Javascript language to perform date operations.
			
			Unix Timestamp: It is number of seconds elapsed from 1 Jan 1970 12:00 am. (Visit for more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time )
		*/

		// Date is a constructor. Constructor in JS is created using functions. Function is internally an object. So, this implies Date is a Constructor and an Object both.

		//	Some methods are available directly on Date object and some methods are available an object created via Date Constructor. Lets examine both:

		Date.now();  // Date object contains method named now() which gives the unix timestamp of the present time.
		// output --> 1460527073313

		Date.parse("Wed, 09 Aug 1995 00:00:00 GMT"); // Converts dateString into unix timestamp, to see all possible combi. of dateString visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse 
		// output --> 807926400000

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		var myDateObject = new Date(); // 'myDateObject' is created using Date() constructor with present date stored.

		myDateObject.getSeconds();  // returns the seconds (seconds recorded when new Date() constructor was called)

		myDateObject.getMinutes(); // returns the minutes (minutes recorded when new Date() constructor was called)

		myDateObject.getHours();   // returns the hour (hour recorded when new Date() constructor was called)

		myDateObject.getDate(); // returns the Date (Date recorded when new Date() constructor was called)

		myDateObject.getMonth(); // returns the (Month number - 1), Jan is 0, Feb is 1 and likewise (Month number recorded when new Date() constructor was called)

		myDateObject.getFullYear(); // returns the Year (Year recorded when new Date() constructor was called)

		myDateObject.getDay(); // return day number, Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, and so on.

		myDateObject.getTime() // Returns Unix timestamp
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		var year = 2012, month = 2, day = 22, hours = 14, minutes = 44, seconds = 59, milliseconds = 103
;
		var anotherDateObject = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds); // You can created any date's and time's Date object.
